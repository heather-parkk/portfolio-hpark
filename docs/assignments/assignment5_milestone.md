# Assignment 5 Milestone

## Heuristic Evaluation

For example, what design decisions do your wireframes make that support the heuristics? Or, do your wireframes violate them in particular ways? In either case, do the heuristics suggest improvements you might make? Finally, what tradeoffs exist between optimizing for some of these heuristics (e.g., have you had to make some sacrifices to learnability to boost efficiency)? Make sure to clearly identify the heuristics you are responding to, and keep your observations grounded by ensuring that you cite a specific aspect of your wireframes with every observation.

## Usability Criteria
### Discoverability: Ease to understand how to operate the interface
- First Page, Log-in, Sign-up, Input General Location: display standard buttons and fill-in headers (as with the greying of text) 
- Survey should include a page on what the survey is for, the options, vaguely going over what types of questions may be asked (possibly the number of questions)
- Rating: Should make the dislike and like look more like buttons, since they have the same grey color as information on the profile; could possibly have a small tutorial on how to rate and evaluate profiles (which is done in some apps)
- Chat space: includes common set-up of other chats, the bottom icons (which two I left blank to later determine what I will put, possibly a "photo image" to send photos) could be amiguous that the two-person icon means meet-up (could put directions there in a tutorial)
- Locate: Bottom bar shows a chat and world (should've included one for looking through matches, and also possibly looking at one's profile)


### Pleasantness: "aesthetically-pleasing"ness
- Overall: super minimalistic format, not meant to have unnecessary clutter, classic serif font to have pleasant/calming feel
- Could consider my target audience: these are travelers -- what aesthetic would they find pleasing? This could possibly have too "elegant" (serif font choice) of an aesthetic. Apps like Tinder and Bumble are more vibrant in their scehemes, but aren't necessarily extremely cluttered -> Would have to rethink what "vibe" I want the app to give off -> Maybe more similar to hinge where it isn't technically "elegant" but more minimalistic than Tinder and Bumble

## Physical Heuristics
### Fitt’s Law: East to reach for interface elements
### Gestalt's Principles: Layout conveying conceptual structure

## Linguistic Level
### Speak a user’s language: Informative, simple messaging
### Information Scent: Hints in navigation
- For Match-map, could include at top: Place the blue circle at the location of where you plan to meet
- For Match, could include directions at the top like "Step #1: Plan the Details", "Step #2: Choose Meet-up Location", "Step #3: Give us an Emergency Contact". Emergency contact should also include a brief description of why the app is asking for this information, and possibly an opt-out option since people may not want an emergency contact given(?) --> Adds more "clutter" instead of a minimalistic feel, but would be a helpful tradeoff for those confused users
