# Assignment 2

### Interviewees: 
- **Manuel (Unemployed)**
- **Lydia (USC)**

## Hunch
I would like to build a social media app catered towards travelers, whether solo backpackers or group travelers, who want to experience their travels with new people. Specifically, I would want to know what functionalities/features travelers would be most interested in, and how they have used various other apps to find backpackers.

### Current Issues of Social Networks
- Echo chambers
- Security & safety
    - **Anecdote:** California backpacker I met falling into scams when on Tinder to meet new people
- Misinformation
- Government regulation of social networks
- Mental health impact on social networks

### Interviewers:
##### Manuel
- Backpacker that I met in Vietnam & Thailand from Germany (half German, half Spaniard)
- Wanting to know how he planned his trip (European perspective) & how he is using it now (I don’t think he uses social media a lot)
- Backpacker who is doing more freestyle compared to planned
- Met on Bumble

##### Lydia
- Backpacker I met in Thailand from the US (American Chinese)
- Made set itinerary for herself across SE Asia
- Met on Bumble BFF; know you used Tiktok for your travels

## Questions
- What would you consider the popular social media apps in your country?
- Can you describe your daily routine in using social media apps?
- What do you generally search for on social media – do you use it to find information or solely communicate with others?

#### Travel Specific Questions
- How have you used social media to help plan your travels (whether it be backpacking this time around or in the past?)
- Which apps have you used to meet strangers online in person while traveling? Can you describe your experience meeting strangers on social media while traveling?
- How safe do you feel about it? Do you have any personal anecdotes?
- What additional features do you think would make you feel safer about meeting fellow backpackers? How do you feel about that security-wise?
- What would an app for backpackers look like in your mind?
- Algorithms question: What have you heard about the “algorithm” whether on Instagram or Tiktok? What are your general sentiments towards it?
- What do you think an algorithm should consider if it were to match you with other backpackers?
- Optional question: Can you show me how you navigate to find travel recommendations on your apps?

## Paragraph Report
In conducting my interviews, I contacted two backpackers I met while backpacking in Southeast Asia this summer. The first was Manuel, a German-Spanish backpacker I explored nightlife within both Bangkok and Hanoi. The second was Lydia, a Chinese-American backpacker I met in Bangkok and went cafe-hopping with. I wanted to ask both of these individuals based on their different experiences traveling as a European versus American and man versus woman when meeting strangers online via social media. I had 10 general questions and included many follow-ups depending on what each individual answered to make the conversation more free-flowing. 

#### Manuel (did not want to be recorded):
Manuel worked as a bank advisor at *anonymous bank*, but he quit his job to pursue backpacking. He does not use social media often, mostly just Whatsapp and Snapchat for chatting with friends and indirectly using Reddit when searching for suggestions on Google (and not formally looking on the Reddit app because he does not find the search algorithm to be helpful). He has stopped using Instagram because it was addicting. He has primarily used dating apps such Bumble and Tinder, which he has paid premium services for both, to meet people (mainly for hooking up) while traveling. Most of these have been nonlocals, mainly other Europeans. He has never felt much worry about meeting strangers, though he encountered one scam where a woman met up with him, led him to a nightclub, pressured him to buy expensive alcohol, and then abandoned him when he refused to do so. Most of the people he has become friends with throughout his travels he met naturally through hostels or tours but has become friends with around 15% of the people he has met on dating apps. We also discuss about how he feels a bit lonely at times since he is away from friends, which I was surprised about since he talked plenty about the people that he met and hooked up with via dating apps – so I felt backpackers are still missing a piece of connections and meaningful friendship when traveling. 

It seems that for heterosexual male users of these dating apps, more of the threat when meeting women is falling for scams (as will be referred to by Lydia’s interview anecdote below by a backpacker she met, but she faced different sentiments). Safety measures that we talked about included verified profiles and possibly passports, but then we also discussed the caveat of a company having access to people’s identification (which he felt comfortable with since it is already being used in companies such as AirBNB to book homestays). An app for backpackers would be helpful since he noticed lots of the backpackers he met naturally are willing to meet people but also do not want to download dating apps since they are affiliated with hook-up culture, but he mostly downloaded those apps for these purposes. Before this interview I was very wary about security when meeting people online, but realized that the precautions other apps already use seem to be “enough” to him, since he believes he has a gut instinct where you can “just tell from if someone sounds fake or like AI” to not meet with them. 

#### Lydia (recorded):
Lydia is a university student at the Univesity of Southern California who was here solo backpacking after her school’s study abroad program. She only met with two people on her travels, myself and another Californian boy, since she didn’t feel much of a need to be with other people when solo traveling. When talking about her general social media habits, she mainly uses TikTok or Instagram to “doom scroll”, or meaninglessly scroll through photos and videos as a form of entertainment, and admits she is a “social media addict.” For travel, she has saved collections on Tiktok on things to do in each country. She specifically used Bumble BFF to meet people, since it “helps when you’re in a new country because you’re swiping through other travel buddies,” since the app has more foreigners than locals. She also felt relatively safe meeting people since “there [are] always catfish[es] but there’s also a gut instinct” when she did decide to meet people. Her encounters with people were more tourist-y, such as going to restaurants or markets. The second person she met was a man from Calfornia, who she told me had his own scam experience in Vietnam when a woman proposed a date with him at a restaurant, and when he searched the restaurant on Google Maps, he saw a review that said “do not go on a Tinder date with a woman to this restaurant.” 

I was able to converse more with Lydia about shared experiences not wanting to meet with men because of the dangers, which I couldn’t with Manuel. And she gave more perspectives on factors she would consider when meeting a person: travel style, wanting to prefer meeting women for safety reasons, intentions of meeting someone (tourist attractions, meals, nightlife). She thinks this form of app would be useful because there was a point in time where she wanted to meet other backpackers to join her to come to Malaysia but she didn’t want to use a more popular app such as Tinder because she didn’t want the intentions of hooking up or going on dates with a woman since she preferred traveling with women. She described how she doesn’t "want to meet with a strange man; girls are fine but I feel like more guys use dating apps.” I’d want to focus on something that focuses on female safety intentions. She also showed me how she “doom scrolls” and a bit of her collections on TikTok to organize her videos, but there didn’t seem to be anything special about how she categorizes videos other than by country – she enjoyed Tiktok for its simple layout. 

## Design Opportunities

#### Developing an algorithm matching traveler buddies
Unlike how Tinder, Hinge, or Bumble use algorithms to show your matches (based on level of desirability: [Vox Article on Tinder Algorithm](https://www.vox.com/2019/2/7/18210998/tinder-algorithm-swiping-tips-dating-app-science), I would want my algorithm to attempt matching people the best on their travel styles and goals. Though unsure of every factor I’d want to include, this could help backpackers find fellow people to create memories with when they are feeling lonely or feel safer when traveling if they have a buddy. But I would also want to consider general friendship compatibility (as noticed through Manuel’s experience meeting people). 

#### Shared Calendar/log for backpackers (unclear exact visual idea)
I’d want to create a visual that allows backpackers to see when/where their “matches” will be in other countries, regardless of whether they are in the same country. Being able to meet the same people in multiple countries (as Manuel and I did) made our friendship grow closer and feel more comfortable. This can allow people to have the option of meeting someone they know they feel safe with. There is not feature like this on dating apps since the goal of those apps isn’t to meet people in several different countries. 

#### New forms of security/safety measures for users
Alongside facial verification which is offered by dating apps, we could also use Passport verification as an extended form of security, though not required by users (but can be evaluated by other users as a consideration to meet with someone). However, I’d want to extend more possible ways we can consider safety and make sure people will not be scammed/assaulted when meeting with these individuals – I’d have to research more about how other apps do this. Safety is a big deterrent as to why some people do not meet with others (such as Lydia) so this could help users in that way. 

#### Meet-up Map
This was an idea that Lydia and I talked about as we were conversing during the interview for ideas. There could be a version of a map where users could mark general locations they have met with other backpackers so people know where popular places are, and it could standardize marked “verified safe locations that are public. Since apps such as Tiktok or Reddit have a plethora of information and have been more solidified as sources of information, it may be harder for my new social media app to start itself as an information hub as well, so having a feature like this could possibly integrate information from those apps within it, though the exact way of how this is done is not defined yet. This would be useful in terms of the “finding information” side of backpackers and safety of meeting strangers.
