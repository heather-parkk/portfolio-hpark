# Assignment 2

## Broad Application Goals: 
#### Name: Nomadly 
- For all the nomads :))

#### Audience: 
- Travelers (mainly backpackers, but open to luxury travelers, expats, eco-tourists, digital nomads, volunteer travelers – could look into the goals and interests of each of these groups)

#### Value: 
- Nomadly would be an application for matching, connecting, and meeting other travelers abroad. 
- Possible value: Nomadly uses a similar interface to dating apps to make matching and connecting simple for its users.
(possibly locals wanting to interact with travelers; e.g. practice their English with other people – an idea I can look into if I have time) to socialize with

## Scrapbook of Comparables:
#### Backpackr
- Backpacking app to “find others travelling to the same destination, collect virtual stamps and share photos with friends as you go” (from homepage)
