# Importance of Arrow Direction in Designing a Database: Privacy

In regards to social media platforms the directionality between users is vital in terms of the relationship between two users and access to privacy in regards to "followers." 

For example, on an app such as Instagram, the "follow" relationship is inherently directional. If "User A follows User B," the arrow in our classical design approach would point from User A to User B. Of course, these "arrows" can be bi-directional, where "User A follows User B" and "User B follows User A." However, with a uni-directional arrow relationship between users where we do not clarify well who follows who (as mentioned in lecture), this can lead to potential dangers in data privacy.

For example, let's say we have a arrow connected A to B, but there is so specification to whether A "follows" B or B "is followed by" A. In this situation, if it is bidirectional, this could lead to the wrong person being able to access a person's profile and access to other data if there person who is being followed is private. 

Examples of misinterpretation of "arrows" within databases can be furthered in more extreme examples, such as healthcare or within the government. Let us say we had a healthcare provider who was to have access to the patient's files. But instead, the patient ended up having access to the healthcare provider's files. Thus specification and directionality in data is extremely important.
