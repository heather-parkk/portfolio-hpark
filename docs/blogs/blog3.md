When discussing the forms of design testing, I wanted to analyze how well-known companies prefer to do their user testing. Two specific methods caught my interest: Wizard of Oz testing and Dogfooding.

# Wizard of Oz Testing

With Wizard of Oz Testing, which has been used by companies such as Zappos and Expensify, the testers will interact with a product, but there is actually a manually-performed backend (just as the Wizard of Oz was hiding behind the curtains to show off his "wizardness").

For example, with Zappos, they first used this method, where instead of developing an entire website for e-commerce system upfront, the creators would list shoes they didn’t even own. When customers made purchases, the team would then go out, buy the shoes, and ship them. Thus, the method would allowed Zappos to test the concept of an online shoe store without building the tedious technology first.

There are various form of a ["Wizard of Oz study"](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/wizard-of-oz/). There are closed, hybrid, and open forms. Closed has a set list of responses able to choose, while open only has custom responses for a tester to select one, and hybrid being a mixture of both. Depending on the form of response, it can allow for tolerance of unexpected answers, severe variation, or easier to interpret responses.

## Why This Method?
The Wizard of Oz method is useful in that it allows companies to gather feedback on how users interact with a product's interface and processes, without needing to invest heavily in backend development early on. The company can see the primary usability issues and interests of the users to then devote all its resources there later.

# Dogfooding
"Dogfooding," which comes from the phrase of “eating your own dog food,” is a form of testing where people within companies using their own products internally before releasing them to the public. We spoke in lecture how its useful to have people who are not related or have no knowledge of the product to test, while this does the opposite.

Used in companies such as Google have employees internally use their products before launchingl, to then see functionality in the real-world.

## Why This Method?
The allure of dogfooding is that employees are more likely to be truthful and harsh in terms of needs for improvements, as we mentioned in lecture some people may feel hesitant/nervous in critiquing or testing products. Additionally, while in examples of controlled testing of users in the videos we watched in lecture, it may not be a realistic way of how a user may face a product. With dogfooding, employees using these features day-to-day may reveal additional issues that wouldn't be revealed with conventional testing.
