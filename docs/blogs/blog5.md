# Importance of BCorps
I first heard about bcorps from a Social Entrepreneurship class that I took in high school as an elective. I will say a strong motivator of why I chose to take the class was because I loved the teacher (who was a coach for our school's MUN team) and I came in with zero knowledge of entrepreneurship.

However, bcorps have still remained within my mind and when I go to shop. I don't think I purchase many things often, but when I do (also because of the fear of how all of my choices have consequences because of the TV show "The Good Place"), I've tried to make sure my dollar goes to where it counts. I know I don't do this all the time, but I think at least going in with the intention demonstrates importance as well.

For those who also want to look into bcorps, the official website has a ["search"](https://www.bcorporation.net/en-us/find-a-b-corp/), where you can look at certain keywords and also look to see if companies you already have invested in/love are bcorps as well. Even moreso, you can see what different demographics have founded the companies (Black, LGBTQ, women, etc. )

I think that though we talked about the process of bcorps, and I remember being skeptical about them at first, people should know the different between a bcorp and any other company who has a social mission. Within this ["Forbes article"](https://www.forbes.com/sites/melissawheeler/2024/04/18/leading-with-purpose-csr-esg-b-corps-and-social-enterprise/), the emphasis between the two is demonstrated really well. A Bcorp has to go thorugh a breadth of different certifications and checks in order to count themselves as a Bcorp, which is why the ["standards"](https://www.bcorporation.net/en-us/standards/) are so high. 

One final article that I suggest people to read about Bcorps is this ["Harvard Business School"](https://hbr.org/2016/06/why-companies-are-becoming-b-corporations) article, talking about the social movement and why companies aim to be Bcorps. 

* One bonus article that I thought is fun and I strangely thing about time to time is how every single one of our actions has an effect, whether it is intended or not intended. Though this is a spoiler to the TV show the Good Place, this is also an interesting article to read about the ["consequences of our actions"](https://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2019/11/the-good-place-the-bad-place-and-the-ugly-consequences/) (and maybe will motivate you to look into what companies you support)
